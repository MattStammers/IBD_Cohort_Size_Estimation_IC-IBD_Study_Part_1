### How to Use Yourself

Analysts must prepare the environment appropriately. I have written a guide before which I will link into this repo. Alternatively, if you are new to python and working in a healthcare context I recommend visiting for a basic-advanced quick into: [NHS BI Analyts Python for Data Science Intro](https://github.com/MattStammers/Community_Of_Practice_Session_Two)

To run the code you will have to appropriately prepare your (ideally poetry environment) study_id's and string data into seperated columns in a dataframe. I recommend using .py files rather than .ipynb notebooks for this but the choice is up to you and will to some degree depend upon level of experience. 

You will also need to prepare all your notebooks and re-organise the code around your own data such that you can run it which is a lot of effort but if you manage it then it will run. I might create pseudodata in future but for now you have to generate the /data folder yourself. 

Realistically, only very determined people are going to do this but that is the point of putting the code out - to maximise transparency.
